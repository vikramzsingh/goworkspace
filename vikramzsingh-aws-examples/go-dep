# Installing dep
 go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
 
 # create project
 mkdir example_project
 cd example_project

# Now, we'll initialize the project:
 dep init -v (v verbose-flag is used to see what is dep doing, because some time dep is slow for min)
 ls
 Gopkg.toml Gopkg.lock vendor/
 
# add a package 
 dep ensure -add github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda
 
# check status/ enjoy the fruit
 dep status -v
 
# if you care about git repo size
 dep prune
 
# test if Gopkg.toml file still good
 rm -rf ./vendor
 dep ensure -v 
 .. build project
 
 # whenever you don't know what to do
  dep ensure -v
